# Privacy policy

Tsumiru is a free, open-source app. It is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

**Tsumiru has no analytics, no crash reporting, no telemetry, and no account with us.** We run no servers that collect your usage, and we receive nothing about what you read.

There are two exceptions, both covered below: the **Suggestions** feature asks a few public manga databases for similar titles, which sends them a series' title — on unless you turn it off. And **update checks** ask GitHub whether a newer Tsumiru release exists, either when you tap to check yourself or, if you turn it on, in the background.

## How Tsumiru works

Tsumiru is a **client** for a [Suwayomi server](/docs/guides/getting-started) that you run and control. The only server Tsumiru talks to is the one **you** configure. Your library, reading history, downloads, and the sources you browse all live on your own server, not on any service we operate.

* Tsumiru sends requests to the server address you enter, plus any credentials you provide to reach it. The exceptions are Suggestions and update checks (both below).
* App settings (such as your server address and reader preferences) are stored locally on your device.
* We receive nothing.

## Suggestions

The **Suggestions** row on a series' details page shows similar titles. To build it, Tsumiru asks these public manga databases for recommendations, sending them the series' title (and sometimes its source link):

* AniList
* MyAnimeList
* MangaDex
* MangaUpdates
* Comick

These requests go straight from your device to those services, not through your Suwayomi server. Each has its own privacy policy.

**Suggestions is on by default.** To turn it off, open **Settings → Appearance** and switch off **Show recommendations**. With it off, Tsumiru makes no requests to those services.

## Update checks

Tsumiru can ask GitHub (github.com) whether a newer release is available, in two ways:

* Tapping the update check on the **About** screen. This only runs when you ask.
* A background check, gated by **App update notifications** under **Settings → Notifications**. This is off by default.

Either way, the request only fetches the latest release listing. It carries no account, library, or reading data.

## Third-party content

Your Suwayomi server connects to third-party sources and, optionally, tracking services (such as MyAnimeList or AniList) that **you** configure on the server. Those services have their own privacy policies, and any data shared with them is governed by your server's configuration, not by Tsumiru.

If you open an external link from within the app, you'll be taken to a site we don't operate; review that site's own privacy policy.

## This website

The same goes for tsumiru.app itself: this site sets no cookies and runs no analytics or trackers.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be published on this page.
